# html-css
I made one page and didn't bother to make the other pages.
Learned responsive design a little bit.
Font Awesome icons were hard for me to implement but did it eventually.
Place to store all my newbie HTML-CSS snippets.
Also trying to figure out how to change the master branch to main branch.
